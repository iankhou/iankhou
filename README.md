### Ian K. Hou
New engineer at AWS CDK Core team 🧑‍🔧

Currently working on an online version of 陸戰棋 (LuZhanQi) in collaboration with @fireteam99, a strategic Chinese board game that roughly translates to "Army chess." ~~🚧 Check out our [alpha deployment](https://luzhanqi-staging.netlify.app). 🚧~~ 

The alpha delpoyment is down, Heroku money ran out :(
